# Posture-Tracker
Overview
A Python-based computer vision tool developed to monitor ergonomic alignment using real-time pose estimation.

How it Works
Uses MediaPipe to track skeletal landmarks.

Calculates the angle between the Ear, Shoulder, and Hip to detect slouching.

Triggers a visual alert when the angle exceeds a biomechanically-safe threshold.
