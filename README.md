# Posture-Tracker
Overview: A Python-based computer vision tool developed to monitor ergonomic alignment using real-time pose estimation.

How it Works
- Uses MediaPipe to track skeletal landmarks
- Calculates the angle between the middle of eyes and middle of shoulders
- Triggers a visual alert when the angle exceeds a biomechanically-safe threshold

Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy
